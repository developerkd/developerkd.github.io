<h2>OpenSoftLab Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Last Updated: 24 July 2016</p></strong>
<p>Your privacy is important to OpenSoftLab. This Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store information that we receive when you use our Services. Please take a moment and read over our privacy policy and let us know if you have any questions. This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services and applications included within “Services” and doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>
<h3>Collection and Use of PII</h3>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of PII we may collect and how we may use it.</p>
<h4>How we collect and use information</h4>
<uL>
  <li>When you register we may collect a variety of information, including your name, address, phone number, email address and -contact preferences(<strong>“Personally Identifiable Information”</strong> or <strong>“PII”</strong>).</li>
  <li>We may collect information you provide us with such as your gender and information about your interests while using the app or online game.</li>
  <li>If you chat with other BrainTeaser users you provide us the content of your chats and if you contact our Support staff or any BrainTeaser staff member you provide us with the content of that communication. BrainTeaser can decide that the content of that communication is in some way inappropriate and terminate the users account. OpenSoftLab may, but is not obligated to monitor or review any content you post as a part of the service.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How we use your PII</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We also use PII to help us develop, deliver, and improve our Services.</li>
  <li>We may also use PII for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve OpenSoftLab's Services and customer communications.</li>
  <li>We may use PII to develop, display, and track content and advertising specific to your interests expressed using the services and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites.</li>
  <li>We may use PII to verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and promotions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for OpenSoftLab to disclose your PII. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all PII we collect to the relevant third party.</p>
<h4>Protection of PII</h4>
<p>OpenSoftLab takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your PII against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<h4>Integrity and Retention of PII</h4>
<p>We will retain your PII for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h4>Access to PII</h4>
<p>For other PII, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to such PII so you can request that we correct or delete the PII we have about you. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting OpenSoftLab at <a href="mailto:opensoftlabs@gmail.com">opensoftlabs@gmail.com.</a></p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<h4>International Users</h4>
<p>Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. If you’re located outside the India and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there. Your use of the Services followed by your submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<h4>Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
<p>OpenSoftLab may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. When we change the policy in a material way, we’ll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective. A notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
